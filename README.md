# QuantumFoundryInternship

The quantum foundry internship was an 8 week program at UCSB where I had the pleasure of working on aluminum gallium arsendide micro-ring resonators in the quantum photonics lab. My research focued on electro-optic tuning on the AlGaAs material platform. One of the most imporant tasks of my research was to write a script that would find split peaks at single resonances.

## Split Peak Detection

This program analyzes transmission spectra from ring resonators and looks for splitting at single resonance peaks. The general steps that describe the development of the project were as follows:

1. Read and Plot
  - Read in a mat file into python
  -
